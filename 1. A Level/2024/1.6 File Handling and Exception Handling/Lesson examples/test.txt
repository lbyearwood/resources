Programming languages have different syntax for writing to and reading from a file
Typically, a statement to open the file will be required
The mode also has to be specified â€“ e.g. write to a new file, append data to an existing file or read an existing file
The actual file name and path needs to be assigned to the identifier used for the file in the program
